Abstract
Objective—The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity
Act prohibits commercial group health plans from imposing spending and visit limitations for
mental health and substance abuse services that are not imposed on medical-surgical benefits.
Controversially, the Act also restricts the use of managed care tools that apply to the behavioral
health benefit in ways that differ from their application to the medical-surgical benefit. The only
precedent for this approach is Oregon’s state parity law, implemented in 2007. The goal of this
study is to estimate the effect of Oregon’s parity law on expenditures for mental health and
substance abuse treatment services.
Methods—We compared expenditures for individuals in four Oregon commercial plans from
2005 through 2008 to a matched group of commercially insured individuals in Oregon who were
exempt from parity. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we analyzed the effect of
comprehensive parity on spending for mental health and substance abuse services.
Results—Increases in spending on mental health and substance abuse services following
Oregon’s parity law were due almost entirely to a general trend observed among individuals with
and without parity. Expenditures per enrollee for mental health and substance abuse services
attributable to parity were positive but did not differ significantly from zero in any of the four
plans (range: +$12.15 to +$25.49, p>0.05 for each comparison).
Conclusion—Behavioral health insurance parity that places restrictions on how plans manage
mental health and substance abuse services can improve insurance protections without substantial
increases in total costs.
INTRODUCTION
Coverage of mental health and substance abuse treatment on par with medical-surgical
benefits is a policy option often referred to as “parity.” Without parity laws, commercial
insurers have tended to limit coverage for mental health and substance use services,
primarily because of concerns that equalizing coverage for these services would lead to
substantial increases in utilization and spending.(1–4) Advocates for parity believe that the
policy will increase access to mental health and substance abuse treatment and reduce outAddress

of-pocket costs for consumers. After years of failed attempts at the federal level, advocates
for parity won a significant victory in 2008, when President George W. Bush signed into law
the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act
(MHPAEA), PL 110–343 (2008). The law became effective beginning in October, 2009.
The federal law represents a new era for coverage of behavioral health conditions. It is
substantially more comprehensive than the previous federal parity law and considerably
stronger than most state parity laws. The law requires plans covering mental health and
substance abuse services to offer them at the same level of benefits for those services as they
provide for medical-surgical services. In other words, the law forbids health plans from
employing “quantitative” treatment limitations (such as spending and visit limitations for
behavioral health services) that are more restrictive than those offered for physical health.
Furthermore, it also disallows the use of “non-quantitative” treatment limitations that affect
the scope or duration of benefits for treatment and that apply to behavioral health but not
physical health.
By addressing “non-quantitative” treatment limitations, the law has been interpreted as a
restriction on the use of managed care tools (such as medical necessity, prior authorization
or utilization review) that apply to the behavioral health benefit in ways that differ from their
application to the medical-surgical benefit. The interim regulations implementing the
MHPAEA, released in 2010, have been controversial and the subject of a lawsuit by
managed behavioral health organizations that was intended to stop their implementation.(5)
The plaintiffs argued that total costs would rise under the federal parity law if they were
prohibited from managing behavioral health services differently than medical-surgical
services.
Previous studies have consistently demonstrated that parity, coupled with differential
management of the behavioral health benefit, can be implemented without large increases in
the cost of behavioral health services.(6–11) In fact, when parity was introduced in the
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the Office of Personnel Management
encouraged its health plans to implement mental health carve outs and to increase the use of
utilization management in anticipation of cost increases.(8) Implementation of the
MHPAEA is most clearly differentiated from previous parity implementations because the
regulations restrict the use of the very non-quantitative treatment limits many believe are
responsible for containing behavioral health costs.(12) It is unclear if behavioral health
parity will lead to higher costs if behavioral health services are not allowed to be managed
differently than medical-surgical services.
In this study, we examine the effects of Oregon’s comprehensive state parity law,
implemented in 2007. Oregon’s law is among the most comprehensive state parity laws,
broadly defining mental health, including alcohol and substance abuse, and including no
small business exemptions (see Table 1). The Oregon law is particularly noteworthy – and
parallels the MHPAEA – in its restrictions on management of the benefit, disallowing the
differential use of non-quantitative treatment limitations. Thus, the Oregon law is of
particular salience to the federal experience. Presumably, if Oregon’s parity implementation
has led to substantial increases in expenditures for behavioral health services, this would
argue in favor of differential management of the behavioral health benefit. However, if
comprehensive parity, coupled with the same management applied to the medical-surgical
benefit, has had a negligible effect on expenditures in Oregon, then differential management
may not be necessary. In this case, there may not be a strong economic argument against the
restrictions on non-quantitative treatment limitations found in the regulations implementing
the MHPAEA.

METHODS
The Oregon parity law went into effect on January 1, 2007. The statute contained a very
broad definition of mental health and addiction, including almost all disorders in the
American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-IV-TR, revised in 2000). This moved Oregon from a group of seven states with
minimal parity mandates into a select group of two states (the other being Vermont) with the
most comprehensive parity law in the country. Parity applied to in- and out-of-network
providers. The Oregon Insurance Division interpreted the statute to mean that managed care
tools such as “selectively contracted panels of providers, health policy benefit differential
designs, preadmission screening, prior authorization, case management, utilization review,
or other mechanisms designed to limit eligible expenses to treatment that is medically
necessary” could not be used unless there was an analog in the management of medicalsurgical
benefits.(13)
The Oregon parity law applied to all commercially insured group health plans that were not
self insured, representing about 70% of individuals in commercial group plans in Oregon.
The other 30% of individuals in group plans were in self insured plans, in which the
employer contracts with a health plan to administer the benefits but the employer assumes
financial risk for the payment of all claims. These self insured plans are exempt from state
insurance laws as part of the Employee and Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA).
We studied the expenditures and utilization of enrollees between the ages of 4 and 64 who
were continuously enrolled in one of four Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) health
plans affected by the 2007 Oregon parity law. We examined changes in access, out-ofpocket
spending and total spending on mental health and substance abuse services. To
account for changes over time unrelated to the parity law, we used a comparison group of
Oregonians who were continuously enrolled in self insured commercial PPO plans.
Data
We collected information on benefit design and management from structured, on-site
interviews with key informants at each of the four PPO plans. We used an adaptation of the
semi-structured interview schedule developed for the evaluation of parity in the Federal
Employees Health Benefits Program.(8) We collected data on a variety of non-quantitative
treatment limitations that are common to both the Oregon regulations and the MHPAEA,
including prior authorization, the use of treatment plans as a utilization management tool,
and the use of “carve outs” (separate management of the behavioral health benefit by a
specialty organization).
From each of the four PPOs, we also obtained four years of data on enrollment and medical
and pharmacy claims, including two years before and two years after the implementation of
parity. We also obtained claims data on a comparison cohort of individuals continuously
enrolled in self insured plans in Oregon from the Thomson Reuters’ MarketScan database.
We classified inpatient and outpatient services associated with specified mental health and
substance abuse diagnoses and psychotropic medications as mental health and substance
abuse services based on previous work.(8) Briefly, mental health and substance abuse
diagnoses were defined as those with diagnostic codes 291, 292, 295 through 309 (except
305.1 and 305.8), and 311 through 314 in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). An inpatient visit was classified as behavioral
health if the primary diagnosis was a mental health or substance abuse diagnosis. An
outpatient visit was classified as mental health or substance abuse related if it had a mental

health or substance abuse primary diagnosis or a procedure code specific to mental health
and substance abuse care. To identify use of psychotropic medications, we updated
Goldman and colleagues’ methodology(8) to include psychotropic drugs released since
2001. The full list of psychotropic medications is available at Appendix A (SA1).
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the effect of parity on spending and access using the difference-in-differences
method. The difference-in-differences is the average difference (occurring with the
implementation of parity) in outcomes of interest among Oregonians in PPOs affected by
parity, minus the average difference (after the parity implementation) among the comparison
group (individuals in self insured plans not affected by the parity legislation). The first
difference reflects changes in the outcome of interest (use or expenditures) that occur after
the parity implementation. By subtracting the second difference – the changes that occur in
the comparison group – we net out the secular changes that may have occurred for reasons
not related to the parity law. Any remaining significant differences in outcome – the
difference-indifferences – are attributed to the parity legislation.
To estimate the difference-in-differences model, we used a two-part model that
accommodated two important characteristics of health care spending.(14) First, in any given
year, many individuals will not have any behavioral health visits or expenditures. Thus, our
dependent variable will have a large cluster of observations at zero. Second, among
individuals who do use care, the distribution tends to be skewed, with a small proportion of
individuals having high levels of spending. After testing competing models, we settled on a
two-part generalized linear model with a log link and gamma variance distribution to
estimate the relation between spending on mental health and substance abuse treatment and
parity.(15) In our estimates, we show the probability of any use of mental health and
substance abuse services (which is part one of the two-part model), and total spending for
mental health and substance abuse services (which combines part one and part two of the
two part model). We used bootstrapping clustered at the individual level to generate 95%
confidence intervals that account for correlation among repeated annual observations.
Our unit of observation was the person year. There were four observations for each
individual: two years pre-parity, and two years post-parity. In our regressions, we adjusted
for age, gender, the person’s relationship to the policyholder (child or spouse), and a marker
for rural vs. urban residence.(16) The key variables of interest were an indicator variable
assigned a value of one for the post-parity period and zero for the pre-parity period, an
indicator variable assigned a value of one for individuals covered by parity (i.e. not in a self
insured plan) and zero for the comparison group, and the interaction of the two indicator
variables. We conducted analyses on each of the four plans separately, with the self insured
individuals acting as a control group, as well as an analysis that pooled all four plans and
used the self insured individuals as a control group.
In addition to the analyses of the population as a whole, we also provide a subanalyses of the
effect of parity on children (age <=18).
RESULTS
Detailed information on benefit limits and management for the four PPOs are displayed in
Table 2. Whereas previous studies of parity have shown an increase in the use of
management techniques,(8, 9) such as prior authorization and treatment plans, in Oregon the
use of these methods either stayed constant or declined. Among the four plans we studied,
none required preauthorization for outpatient mental health or substance abuse services after
the implementation of parity. Only two of the four PPOs required treatment plans (a written

plan describing goals, methods, and anticipated time for treatment) for outpatient mental
health services, and only one PPO required treatment plans for outpatient substance abuse
services. Nonetheless, there was still considerable variation in the extent to which plans
attempted to manage the behavioral health benefit, and compliance and interpretation of the
parity law was inconsistent across plans.
Table 3 reports descriptive data on individuals in the four PPOs and in the comparison group
(i.e., those unaffected by parity). While there are some statistically significant differences in
the population (e.g., individuals in the self insured group are more likely to be female and
less likely to be the policy holder; individuals in Plan C were less likely to be located in
rural areas), overall the intervention and comparison subjects are fairly comparable and
exhibited a similar prevalence of behavioral health diagnoses.
Table 4 reports rates of use of mental health and substance abuse services and spending for
service users. For all plans, the rates of use and spending increased during the study period.
Table 4 also reports difference-in-differences estimates for the probability of use of mental
health and substance abuse services and for spending on such services. After accounting for
secular trends, the overall estimate of the effect of parity on total behavioral health spending
was moderate, ranging from $12 to $26, and did not differ significantly from zero.
Furthermore, the increases in spending were not necessarily smaller for plans that required
treatment plans or carved out behavioral health care. The largest point estimate increase was
for Plan D ($25.49), which used a carve out and required treatment plans after 8 visits. The
final row in Table 4 displays results from the analysis that pooled plans A, B, C and D. The
point estimate of the effect of parity in the pooled analysis (using 100,328 individuals
subject to parity and 19,634 individuals in self insured plans for comparison) was $15.15
and not significantly different from zero (95% CI −$1.58, $31.25).
Table 5 reports rates of use of mental health and substance abuse services and differenceindifference
estimates of the effect of parity on children. Compared to the population as a
whole, children are much less likely to access care (e.g., a probability of accessing care
almost half that of the general population). However, conditional on accessing care, their
expenditures are higher, so average spending per child beneficiary is relatively close to
average spending per adult. In the difference-in-difference analyses, point estimates for total
change in spending after parity are higher for children than the general population (e.g.,
estimates for children range between +$15.25 to +$36.62, compared to the range of +$12.15
to +$25.49 in the general population). However, in the analyses of children, no plan
demonstrates a statistically significant increase in spending. Separate analyses for adults
(provided in the online supplement) demonstrate similar findings, with estimates of the
effect of parity on adults ranging from of +$12.02 to +$26.29, with none statistically
significant.
Oregon’s parity law also required that co-insurance, co-payments, and deductibles be
identical for behavioral health and medical-surgical care, although this policy had been the
de facto practice for most health plans. Table 6 summarizes the effects of parity on out-ofpocket
spending by users of mental health and substance abuse services. In two of the four
plans, parity was associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in out-ofpocket
spending (Plans A and B). One plan (Plan D) demonstrated a small but statistically
significant increase in out-of-pocket spending. This increase reflected an overall trend in
higher deductibles and cost-sharing that were introduced throughout Plan D’s insurance
offerings.

Sensitivity Analyses
We also estimated our difference-in-difference models using propensity score weighting on
patient demographics and behavioral health risk adjusters.(17) The results from this
approach were qualitatively similar to the results from the difference-in-difference models
without the propensity score model. Thus, the small differences in population characteristics
displayed in Table 3 do not appear to be confounding the estimates of the effect of parity on
behavioral health spending. The details of these analyses along with other analyses that
investigate the adequacy of the control group and provide additional information on the
context of the Oregon parity law are included as an online supplement.
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to examine a parity implementation that restricted non-quantitative
treatment limitations, which is the approach that has been favored in the MHPAEA. The
Oregon Insurance Division actively interpreted the statute to mean that the behavioral health
benefit could not be managed in a way that was different from the medical-surgical benefit.
Our results suggest that this form of parity did not result in increases in expenditures for
mental health and substance abuse services that were substantially larger than those
observed among a comparison group of privately insured individuals not subject to the
parity law.
The point estimate for the change in spending for our four PPO plans was positive and
ranged between $12 and $26, and none differed significantly from zero. One possible
explanation for this negative finding is that our evaluation lacked the necessary power to
show a statistically significant effect. However, the pooled analysis (using 100,328
individuals covered by parity) was not significantly different from zero.
The negative finding could also be related to the notion that parity primarily affects a
relatively small population of individuals who need additional outpatient treatment. The
added expense of this increase in outpatient utilization may be relatively small when
compared to the overall year-to-year spending attributable to inpatient care and prescription
drug use for mental health and substance abuse services. The lack of a significant increase in
expenditures may also be related to plans’ pre-parity approach to the quantitative limits.
During our structured interviews with health plans, several indicated that these limitations
were not 100% binding and exceptions could be made. These exceptions could occur with
providers who were in the plan’s behavioral health network, and would be managed and
observed closely. According to plans, before parity, there was never any exception for
providers who were out of network.
Table 7 provides some indication of the “exceptions” that plans made to their visit
limitations prior to the parity implementation. (We note that our estimate is likely to be
biased upwards since health plans may have differentiated between different types of
outpatient behavioral health visits). In general, approximately 5% of patients with any
behavioral health visit exceeded the specified limits of that plan. The apparent flexibility in
these “limits” prior to the parity law may be one reason that the implementation of parity did
not lead to large increases in spending.
Our negative findings suggest that the impact of federal parity on total health care spending
could be relatively small. Overall, behavioral health expenditures are a small portion of total
spending. In our study, expenditures for mental health and substance abuse services
accounted for approximately 6.0% to 7.4% of total expenditures, depending on the health
plan. An increase in behavioral health spending of $25 (the largest point estimate in our
study) would be equivalent to a 1.0% increase in total spending. Thus, even if parity did

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
result in statistically significant expenditures that our study was not powered to detect, the
impact on the total premium would still be relatively modest.
While many observers believe that managing the behavioral health benefit is beneficial for
patients, some have described the partnering of parity and managed care as “a Faustian
bargain”: undesirable but necessary to keep costs in check.(18) The Oregon experience
suggests that the Faustian bargain may not be necessary. That is, it may be possible to
remove visit limitations without imposing onerous managed care utilization methods on
behavioral health services. However, this does not mean that no managed care would be
optimal. Oregon’s commercial health plans continued to use traditional managed care tools
to control costs and utilization. The distinction enforced by the Oregon Insurance Division
was that plans were not allowed to differentially manage behavioral health services.
Our study has several limitations that should be noted. In our quasi-experimental design, our
comparison group consisted of individuals in Oregon who had commercial insurance and
whose employers were self insured and thus not affected by Oregon’s parity law. There is a
risk that this was not the appropriate comparison group or that this choice did not adequately
control for secular trends. However, it is reassuring that individuals from the self insured
plans generally had similar demographic and spending characteristics and were located in
the same geographical and service areas. Our negative finding could also be attributed to
statewide changes in the ways that providers cared for all of their patients after parity was
implemented. For example, providers may have been confused or unable to discern which
patients were covered by the parity statute and which were not, and may have recommended
additional visits for their entire patient population. If this were the case, it might mask the
increases in spending attributable to parity because the control group was also receiving
more intensive treatment.
However, close inspection of the self insured data did not detect discrete changes in
spending after the Oregon parity law. Rather, spending in the control group followed a
relatively smooth, linear time trend over the four year study period. Figure 1 displays the
average quarterly spending for our self-insured group, compared to a linear trend forecast
based on the first eight quarters (pre-parity) of spending. These data do not suggest any large
changes in spending that coincided with the implementation of the Oregon parity law.
Additional evidence to support our comparison group is provided in the online supplement.
This study is also limited in its analysis of only four PPO plans in Oregon. While these plans
represented the majority of the non-self insured commercial market, they may not be
representative of other commercial plans in Oregon or commercial plans throughout the
United States. Although we conducted extensive interviews with key informants in each of
those plans and documented their management practices, there may be unobserved factors
particular to our four study plans (e.g., cooperative relationships with providers) that
allowed them to keep costs in check.
It is also possible that there may have been other non-quantitative treatment limitations that
were responsible for controlling costs. We focused our attention on the same set of
utilization management techniques that were studied in the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program(19) and in a recent survey of 368 commercial health plans.(20) However,
there may have been other relevant indicators that we did not study. Furthermore, we also
only examined whether plans had certain utilization management policies and not how strict
health plans were in applying them. These data are difficult to obtain and beyond the scope
of this study.
This study is also limited by its time frame, which covered two years of pre-parity and two
years of post-parity observations. While we would expect that this would be adequate to
McConnell et al. Page 7

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
capture changes in patient behavior, it may not be long enough to capture changes in
provider behavior. In particular, if providers see parity laws as an opportunity to expand
business and services, they may invest in infrastructure and facilities that could have longerterm
consequences for the costs of treating behavioral health disorders.
Certain aspects of Oregon’s insurance market and health care delivery system may not be
generalizable to other parts of the country. Oregon is generally considered to have a
competitive insurance market. At least seven Oregon-based plans participate in the non-self
insured group market, with the largest plan only capturing 31% of those beneficiaries.(21)
The state has authority to review proposed rate increases, as well as to regulate health plans
for financial solvency, policy form approval, and consumer protection.(21) There are
undoubtedly differences in the health care markets across states that might affect the
generalizability of our findings. In particular, psychiatric inpatient beds are generally
considered highly constrained in Oregon, which may have limited increases in inpatient use
after parity.
Our findings may presage the experience of health plans around the country as federal parity
is implemented. The experience of Oregon suggests that management of the behavioral
health benefit does not necessarily need to be different than management of the medicalsurgical
benefit in order to control costs as the federal parity law goes into place.
Nonetheless, it does not mean that no management is optimal. In particular, given the
widespread and broad-based nature of the federal law, we need a greater understanding of
the types of benefit management that are best at controlling costs and improving quality, in
order to reap the greatest advantages from the opportunity offered by a national parity law.

Does not prohibit insurers from managing
behavioral health benefits as long as the same
requirements are imposed on the coverage of
other medical conditions. Examples include
management tools such as use of restricted
provider panels, differential benefit designs,
preadmission screening, prior authorization,
case management, and utilization review.
Limits that are comparable to and applied no more
stringently to behavioral health benefits than medicalsurgical
benefits except to the extent that recognized
clinically appropriate standards of care may permit a
difference. Examples include medical management
standards limiting or excluding benefits based on
medical necessity (including utilization review),
formulary designs for prescriptions drugs, standards for
provider network participation, methods for
determining usual, customary and reasonable charges,
requirements for “step therapy” or “fail first” policies,
and exclusions for failure to complete a course of
treatment.
Application to in and out- ofnetwork
benefits
Applies to both in- and out-of-network
benefits.
Applies to both in- and out-of-network benefits.
Exemptions Does not pertain to commercial self insured
(ERISA) plans, individual insurance,
Medicaid, or Medicare
Allows a health plan to be exempted if the plan can
prove that parity raised total plan costs by more than
2% in the first year and 1% thereafter Does not apply to
groups with 50 or fewer individuals
